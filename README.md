# oss_conference_playbook
An open source playbook for how to run a conference

# What I plan to do and what to expect
I've just come off planning PyMCon and it seems like the community really had fun overall, from the volunteers to the attendees. Given that I figure other people would want the same community building fun but don't know where to start. I aim to share the knowledge here so like all open source projects people take ideas and be empowered to run with them.

## How this repo will go
At the start this is going to be a "single contributor" project where I'll largely be writing down my experiences and getting the structure down and be relatively shy about merging PRs. This will also be largely focused on the types of conferences that I've planned. Over time as this repo gets a solid foundation I'll be more apt to start merging in large community prs and changes. The knowledge will stay open the entire time!

## What should be the takeaway
More than anything I want everyone to know that they can plan a conference of their own, big or small. Breaking down mental barriers and imposter syndrome is the first goal. After that it'll be examples and a guide of how this can be pulled off.
