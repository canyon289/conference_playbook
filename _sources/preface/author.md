# Who am I
My name is Ravin Kumar and I'm a big proponent of the free exchange of ideas, the ideals of
[Open Community Approaches](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_community_approach), and 
most generally a fan of unrestricted learning.

As a kid I loved going to the library. As a child it was the one place where I could do what *I* 
wanted, I could pick up books on history, or English, or math. I could pick up fictional stories
about [The Boxcar Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxcar_Children). If after the 3 week
checkout period I wanted to move on I could, or I could double down and renew what I had. I had free
rein to learn in any direction I pleased.

This was more than just shallow fun, it changed my fundamental life experience. From learning
English so I could make friends (English is my second language), or coming to understand 
what how 


Because of this people assumed I'd love grade school, but I did not. At school you get little choice,
you're taught what's prescribed for the duration and depth its prescribed. Your interest in the 
matter was irrelevant. Importantly the teachings were not free, in the sense that talking to your
peers and coming with new approaches was either unsupported or often discouraged. The content 
was restricted based on the agenda of others, not your own.

College was better, I had a choice of major, and some agency over picking my classes and a community
learn with. But it introduced a new problem, the learning was free of of choice, it was ridiculously
but it was not free of cost. Paying a lot of money while not making much was unsustainable.
The learning resources are time limited as well. In one class I was very much enjoying
learning how to weld, but once the semester was over my access was cut off, that ended
my learning post haste.

Doing what most normal people did after college, I did got a job. While I did learn new things
recognize that most companies want you to learn enough to do a specific role, and usually not 
much more. The goal of a company is to achieve some goal, whether it be financial in
National Oilwell Varco's case, or colonizing Mars in SpaceX's case. You get enough support
to achieve the role you've been given but usually not much more. So when I was in the role of
mechanical engineer I was given nearly no training On Data, and at SpaceX I was denied training
on data methods my manager's didn't see it as relevant to my role.
