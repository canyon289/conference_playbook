# A meeting of two or more persons 

Merriam Webster defines a conference as "a meeting of two or more persons for discussing matters of
common concern". It's hard to argue with this definition but it is pretty vague, getting
coffee with a friend, a work meeting, a gym class, or PyCon all meet this definition.

So instead let's start with
a different definition [Open Community](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_community_approach).
Copying from the link *The term “open” for an open community refers to the opportunity for
anyone to join and contribute to the collaborative effort.* Examples of these could include
Open Source Software development, local cooking clubs, online
gaming communities. Copying again from the Wikipedia page, 
"An Open Community Approach never charges money for a service, a product or educational material.
Implementation are driven by donation, donations of labor force to accomplish Open Community Goals."
In my definition these are communities that exist more for the benefit of the members as a whole,
rather than for specific individual in the community, and tend to encourage people to join
under the hopes of advancing a non monetary effort. People join generally to trade their
time and effort for an idea or goodwill of others.


Contrast this a closed community approach, for example an employee at company which not
anyone can just join, and the goals largely are to increase monetary wealth for a subset of its
members.

Why does this matter? The open vs closed approach substantially changes
the entire culture of the community. Consider software development in companies versus
in community open source projects.

Companies maintain structures like Kanban boards and standups for visibility and entire organization
structures with Technical Project Managers, monetary reward structures that incentivize development and
priorities come from people with fancy titles like manager, and vice president and the like. 
People join primarily to trade their effort for money.

Whereas in Open Source typically a bug board or issue tickets create visibility and the motivation
comes from the individuals. Even though the end product is code, the process in which it's generated
looks vastly different. And importantly the ways the humans in the process structure themselves
and interact is different as well.

Many of the principles will be the same just as they are with software development but when planning
a conference around humans it's the intrinsic motivation of folks is relevant at each step. 
So to reiterate we're going to focus this book solely on open communities.

## A rundown Open Community Gatherings
Even after scoping down the communities we're still left with a vague definition of conferences,
so to provide some context I'll enumerate the typical gatherings that open communities have
before finally making our own definition of a conference.


### Unstructured get togethers
These go by names of Hacker Happy Hours, Social Hours, etc. They're largely unstructured other
than setting a time and people just tend to show up, talk, and share ideas. Usually around 2 to 30
people or so show up. Because these are so easy to plan and run requiring almost no work they can
happen as frequently as weekly, and their small size and short duration means they typically cost
no money to attend and no money to for the planners, and the marketing is quite standard.
The type of people that attend typically are the "usual folks". These events are so standard
 communities can set them on an auto reschedule recurrence on platforms like Meetup
and Eventbrite, and somoene just needs to show up to be "the adult in the room".


### Meetups, Seminars, Lectures, Sessions
Most open communities have some sort of monthly session where there is a specific objective.
The most common is a talk from a speaker or 2, where the speaker prepares slides or a demonstration.
These events take a bit more time to plan, as speakers must be identified and coordinated with,
and specific marketing has to take place. I'd consider these to be the bread and butter events
you see in data meetups such as PyData. These meetups dont usually go longer than 4 hours and
depending on the speaker and the group these events usually range between 1 and 200 attendees.
As is such for the larger ones the organizers have to find a space, usually some local company
ends up hosting. As is such these events are held on nights or weekends are not to conflict
with either the hosting companies work day, or the attendees workday. These usually cost
no money to attend as well. The attendees are typically are mix of the usual folks and new folks.
These events are small enough that 1 or 2 community managers can actively plan them through the course
of a year.


### Conferences
Conferences, as we'll define them, are the once a year event that communities hold as their
"premiere" event. Conferences typically span an entire day, if not multiple days. There are
multiple speakers, multiple event types such as talks, tutorials, etc, and between 1 and multiple
thousands of people show up. Conferences are meant to be the one event where all the "core"
community members show up, but due to their size most of the folks that show up are not the regulars.
Unlike other event types conferences typically cost money, both because the scale of the event
means there's real costs, but also because these tend to serve as fundraising events for the 
communities activity over the year as well. Conferences have so many moving pieces 
that it takes multiple people concerted effort over multiple months to get everything together.
