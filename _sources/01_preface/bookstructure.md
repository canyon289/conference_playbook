## What to expect
This book will be an opinionated guide on how to plan and run conferences based on my own personal
experience. It's not meant to be an exhaustive guide on every possible strategy. It is meant to be
a play for play guide on how to run a conference with examples from the various conferences I've 
been a part of. This may change later on as the book evolves.

# The structure of this book
This book is structured as conference planning where we'll progress through each of the steps of
planning a conference as they'd occur. Each section will start with high level conversation,
which will then be followed by concrete examples.

At its most abstract level this book is a collection of ideas you can take to understand the
conference planning process. At its most concrete level this book will be a template where
you can "plug in" your values and get going

# Who this book for
This book is for people in that wish to put on a conference for their
community but are unsure where to start. If using the book as a template it will be most applicable
to gatherings of 1 to ~300 people. However the ideas are universal for conferences of any size,
so even if you are planning a conference that is larger you can use this book as a reference.
