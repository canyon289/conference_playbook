<h1>An Overview of Open Community Gatherings<a class="headerlink" href="#an-overview-of-open-community-gatherings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Now that we’ve scoped down what type of community we’re focusing on,
we’re still left with a vague definition of conferences,
so to provide some context I’ll enumerate the typical gatherings that open communities have
before finally making our own definition of a conference.</p>
<div class="section" id="unstructured-get-togethers">
<h2>Unstructured Get togethers<a class="headerlink" href="#unstructured-get-togethers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These go by names of Hacker Happy Hours, Social Hours, etc. They’re largely unstructured other
than setting a time and people just tend to show up, talk, and share ideas. Usually around 2 to 30
people or so show up. Because these are so easy to plan and run requiring almost no work they can
happen as frequently as weekly, and their small size and short duration means they typically cost
no money to attend and no money to for the planners, and the marketing is quite standard.
The type of people that attend typically are the “usual folks”. These events are so standard
communities can set them on an auto reschedule recurrence on platforms like Meetup
and Eventbrite, and somoene just needs to show up to be “the adult in the room”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meetups-seminars-lectures-sessions">
<h2>Meetups, Seminars, Lectures, Sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#meetups-seminars-lectures-sessions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most open communities have some sort of monthly session where there is a specific objective.
The most common is a talk from a speaker or 2, where the speaker prepares slides or a demonstration.
These events take a bit more time to plan, as speakers must be identified and coordinated with,
and specific marketing has to take place. I’d consider these to be the bread and butter events
you see in data meetups such as PyData. These meetups dont usually go longer than 4 hours and
depending on the speaker and the group these events usually range between 1 and 200 attendees.
As is such for the larger ones the organizers have to find a space, usually some local company
ends up hosting. As is such these events are held on nights or weekends are not to conflict
with either the hosting companies work day, or the attendees workday. These usually cost
no money to attend as well. The attendees are typically are mix of the usual folks and new folks.
These events are small enough that 1 or 2 community managers can actively plan them through the course
of a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conferences">
<h2>Conferences<a class="headerlink" href="#conferences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conferences, as we’ll define them, are the once a year event that communities hold as their
“premiere” event. Conferences typically span an entire day, if not multiple days. There are
multiple speakers, multiple event types such as talks, tutorials, etc, and between one and multiple
thousands of people show up. Conferences are meant to be the one event where all the “core”
community members show up, but due to their size most of the folks that show up are not the regulars.
Unlike other event types conferences typically money is exchanged. From the event planners side
the scale of the event means there’s expenses From the attendees side there usually is a ticket
price, meant to defray the afromentioned cost but also because these tend to serve as fundraising
events for the communities activity over the year as well. In regards to planning team needs
conferences have so many moving pieces that it takes multiple people concerted effort over
multiple months to get everything together.</p>
<div class="section" id="pros-and-cons-of-a-conference">
<h3>Pros and Cons of a Conference<a class="headerlink" href="#pros-and-cons-of-a-conference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So why hold a conference versus a meetup or another get together? Conferences typically</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bring the most people together at one time</p></li>
<li><p>Folks tend to dedicate a day or more to the gather rather than just a single evening</p></li>
<li><p>The activities span the range from “lets teach other hard things” to “lets hang out” for a richer
shared experience</p></li>
<li><p>The revenue from ticket sales helps fund the community</p></li>
<li><p>It’s one of the most effective ways per person to get new folks and expand the community</p></li>
<li><p>It has a big morale boosting effect on the community</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a platform on which to reinforce a vision and direction</p></li>
<li><p>Tends to be the most visible events and distinctive events online</p></li>
<li><p>It just feels “special”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But like anything else there’s downsides. In no particular order</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Conferences take more time both in people time and calendar time to plan</p></li>
<li><p>They can be a financial risk for the event planners</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a lot of ways things can “go wrong”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly though I feel the pros far outweigh the cons and all the downsides can be mitigated with
foresight and good planning. And hey, this is what this book is for, to help you maximize
the chances of running a great conference for whatever you and others think is awesome.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="case-study-pydata-socal-meetup-versus-pydatala">
<h2>Case Study: PyData SoCal Meetup versus PyDataLA<a class="headerlink" href="#case-study-pydata-socal-meetup-versus-pydatala" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As promised we’re by example from others in the community. Being able to identify
conferences “on sight” and discern them from other community gatherings. This  will help in your
planning process as you’ll be able to see what others have done and get an idea for you can do.
Especially for you first conference a good move is to emulate what others have done
that is similar on your space, because you know that what is in demand, and is feasible. In
particular it’ll help to be able to determine which events specifically are conferences
and understand why they’re conferences.</p>
<p>Let’s compare <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-SoCal/events/272879575/">PyData Socal Meetup</a>
versus <a class="reference external" href="https://pydata.org/la2019/">PyData Los Angeles Meetup</a>
to tease apart some of the differences, and share our first examples of open community meetings
and conferences.</p>
<p>If we start with the PyData Socal meetup, the most immediate thing we can see is that it was
a relatively short event, only 2 hours total. The event also only featured one speaker talking about
a one topic. The attendee count is around 71, enough people to fit into auditorium, or a free
videoconferencing software like Zoom or Google meets. Lastly in terms of information on the page
this really is about it, a single page conveys really everything we need to know. If
we click into the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-SoCal/events/past/">events page</a> we see
these style of events recur every multiple times a year. Lastly the registration is
free, there isn’t pricing mentioned anywhere.</p>
<p>Contrast the PyData LA page. There’s multiple keynotes listed on the first page alone, clicking
into the schedule there’s many more and the event spans the entire day. There’s also
multiple styles of events, from keynotes, to tracks, to sprints, to scheduled activities like
social hours. For this particular conference the ticket pricing page has been removed, so you’ll
just have to take it from me that at one point it existed</p>
<p>So now that we’ve done one together let’s use another example from the Infosec space. Here
are two sets of events organized by Null Space Labs, a hackerspace in Southern California.
Compare the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/nullspacelabs/">events here</a> with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.layerone.org/">this one</a>.
How do they comare? What’s similar, what are the differences? Which one is a conference and which is a meetup?</p>
