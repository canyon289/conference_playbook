# A meeting of two or more persons 

Merriam Webster defines a conference as "a meeting of two or more persons for discussing matters of
common concern". It's hard to argue with this definition but it is pretty vague, getting
coffee with a friend could be construed as a conference. So instead let's start with
a different definition [Open Community](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_community_approach).
Copying from from the link *The term “open” for an open community refers to the opportunity for
anyone to join and contribute to the collaborative effort.*
