# Definitions

Merriam Webster defines a conference as "a meeting of two or more persons for discussing matters of
common concern". It's hard to argue with this definition but it is pretty vague, getting
coffee with a friend, a work meeting, a gym class, or PyCon all meet this definition.

So instead let's start with
a different definition [Open Community](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_community_approach).
Copying from the link *The term “open” for an open community refers to the opportunity for
anyone to join and contribute to the collaborative effort.* Examples of these could include
Open Source Software development, local cooking clubs, online
gaming communities. Copying again from the Wikipedia page, 
"An Open Community Approach never charges money for a service, a product or educational material.
Implementation are driven by donation, donations of labor force to accomplish Open Community Goals."
In my definition these are communities that exist more for the benefit of the members as a whole,
rather than for specific individual in the community, and tend to encourage people to join
under the hopes of advancing a non monetary effort. People join generally to trade their
time and effort for an idea or goodwill of others.

Contrast this a closed community approach, for example an employee at company which not
anyone can just join, and the goals largely are to increase monetary wealth for a subset of its
members.

Why does this matter? The open vs closed approach substantially changes
the entire culture of the community. Consider software development at companies versus
in community open source projects.

Companies maintain structures like Kanban boards and standups for visibility and entire organization
structures with Technical Project Managers, monetary reward structures that incentivize development and
priorities come from people with fancy titles like manager, vice president and the like. 
People join primarily to trade their effort for money.

Whereas in Open Source typically a bug board or issue tickets create visibility and the motivation
comes from the individuals. Even though the end product is code, the process in which it's generated
looks vastly different. And importantly the ways the humans in the process structure themselves
and interact is different as well.

At at high level companies and open source use the same technologies, tools, and acronyms. You'll
find python, Continuous integration, testing, milling machines, lathes, and source code decompilers
in both. But the way the humans organize and the motivation lead to different expectations,
schedules, and motivations.

So to reiterate this book will focus on planning conferences for open communities.
Many of the principles will be the same just as they are with software development but when planning
a conference for a community the intrinsic motivation of folks is relevant at each step.
