Conference Planning Playbook
============================

Welcome to the Conference Planning playbook. This book will share how structure, documents, and tips
for how plan conferences for folks to share ideas and inspiration, earn revenue for your 
community, and generally just bring people together.

I've just come off planning PyMCon and it seems like the community really had fun overall, from the
volunteers to the attendees. Given that I figure other people would want the same community building
fun but don't know where to start. I aim to share the knowledge here so like all open source projects
people take ideas and be empowered to run with them.
 
## Please pardon the dust
This book with be developed in an "Open Source Software" fashion, where chapters are shared as they're
written. This is get the ideas out there, and improve on the over time, particularly
with community input. Given the COVID pandemic I particularly want to empower people as quickly
as possible.

As a reader expect this book to be in an *alpha* state. For now there'll be rough edges and typos.
