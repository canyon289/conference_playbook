Conference Planning Playbook
============================

Welcome to the Conference Planning playbook. This book will share how structure, documents, and tips
for how plan conferences for folks to share ideas and inspiration, earn revenue for your 
community, and generally just bring people together.


## Please pardon the dust
I'm writing this book in an "Open Source Software" fashion, where I write a prototype quickly
to get the ideas out there, and build and improve on the core sections over time, particularly
with community input. Given the COVID pandemic I particularly want to empower people as quickly
as possible.

As a reader expect this book to be in an *alpha* state. For now there'll be rough edges and typos.
